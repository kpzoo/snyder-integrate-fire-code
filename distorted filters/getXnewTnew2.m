% Modified to remove repetitions in the estimated photon stream by slight
% displacement of the times

% Simple function to reconstruct a new X vector which consists of estimated
% photon times (x2 births) that are supplied
function [Tnew Xnew] = getXnewTnew2(T, X, TphEst)

% Remove repetitions in estimates if they exist
[TphEst normVal newlen oldlen] = removeRepetition(TphEst);
if newlen == oldlen && normVal == 0
    % Case of no repetitions
    disp('No initial repetitions in photon stream');
else
    % Loop function until all repetitions removed
    while newlen ~= oldlen
        [TphEst normVal newlen oldlen] = removeRepetition(TphEst);
    end
end

% Use photon times to generate corresponding x2
x2new = 1:length(TphEst);
x2new = x2new';

% Obtain original x1 and x2
x1 = X(:, 1);
x2 = X(:, 2);

% Remove old x2 times from data vectors

% Add new x2 times and sort T vector

x2new = x2new(idsort);
% assignin('base', 'x1newL', x1new);
% assignin('base', 'x2newL', x2new);

% Adjust values of x1new and x2new for consistency - x1new has zeros that
% need to be replaced with values  matching previous event and x1 has zeros
% that need to match surrounding values at the new photon times
idcurr = zeros(size(TphEst));
idcurr(1) = find(Tnew == TphEst(1));
for i = 2:length(TphEst) 
    % Obtain current photon event id
    idcurr(i) = find(Tnew == TphEst(i));
    
    % Indices before the id must have same x2 value as only at the event
    % id is x2 incremented
    if idcurr(i) ~= 1
        x2new(idcurr(i-1):idcurr(i)-1) = x2new(idcurr(i-1));

    % occurred at this point (at i = 1 its zero)
